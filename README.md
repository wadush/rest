# UIB-Client-work

You are being asked by an italian restaurant to make them a website. On it they want the following:

1. A home page with general Information about the restaurant
2. A menu page, listing foods and prices.
3. An image gallery with images of foods.
4. A navbar to get to the different sites.
5. A contact page with the phone number and email adress
6. A footer, also with phone number and email adress.

Heres their acceptance criteria:
1. It should work on mobile devices.
2. It should look really nice.

Hints:
    1. Draw your website with pen and paper first before you design it.
    2. For now just find photos of italian food on google for the image gallery.
    3. Use flexbox and media queries for responsiveness. 

    Good Luck :-)
